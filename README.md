## Links to the helpful tutorials
During the projects, students need to create the experience in a virtual building with a realistic appearance.


### - Virtual Building

The 3D model of the building can be either downloaded from the asset store, or created using the Probuilder tool in Unity. 

#### -- Some examples for 3D models of the buildings are placed in these folders of the unity project: 

* For downloaded models: Assets -> Models -> Buildings -> DownloadedBuildings. 

* For models created by Probuilder tool: Assets -> Models -> Buidlings -> CreatedByProBuilder.

### - Realistic appearance for the 3D models

In order to give realistic appearance to objects and buidlings, realistic material should be created and applied to the surfaces.

#### -- Some example for realistic materials are placed in this folder of the unity project: 
* Assets -> Materials&Textures
